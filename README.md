# Cryptocurrencies

# Purpose of the project:
The purpose of the project is to use unsupervised machine learning to create clusters for various cryptocurrencies, for the client Accountability Accounting to offer a cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.

In the process, we used Python's Pandas library to clean and transform the data. Removing data that won't be useful in the machine learning algorithms, transforming the text data to numeric data, and scaling and normalizing the data. Then we use Scikit-learn's PCA module to reduce the number of data. And we use Scikit-learn's KMeans module, first, we prepare the data and create the elbow curve plot to determine the number of K (clusters), then we train the machine learning model, and to predict the clusters for the cryptocurrencies' data.

We also use the data to create a 3D scatter plat, a 2D scatter plot, and a table with the original data plus the data that we transformed and used in the machine learning algorithms.
